MFPS has attained the Singapore Quality Class certification administered by SPRING Singapore. The SQC is a significant milestone of achievement for our school’s excellence journey. Our school was assessed by both Spring Singapore and MOE in February 2013 using the SQC framework for business excellence as well as the School Excellence Model. The SQC attainment validates and affirms our school’s sound management systems and processes towards delivering sustained positive results for our pupils, parents and other stakeholders.
