### **National Arts Education Award (Glow, 2011)**
The NAE Award is a national arts award for schools in Singapore. The National Arts Council (NAC) presents this Award annually to:

*   recognise schools that provide opportunities for all students to be involved and showÂ excellence in the arts;
*   encourage and reward schools with good arts practices and programmes.

The NAE Award Criteria is based on the Arts Education Evaluation Framework, developed by the Curriculum Planning and Development Division, Ministry of Education (MOE).

As part of our continuous improvement in our processes and our impact in arts education within school and across school communities, we progressed from a NAE (Bronze) award to a NAE (Glow) award in 2011.
