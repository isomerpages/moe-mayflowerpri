Mayflower Primary School has achieved the National Arts Education Award (NAEA) 2015 – Blaze. The Blaze category of the NAEA is the highest level of attainment, in recognition of the school’s efforts in building a vibrant arts culture, advocates and champions the arts, contributes to the community, and provides assistance to other schools in their arts education development.

This achievement is an affirmation of MFPS’s collective belief that ‘Every Pupil is an Artist’, and an important validation of the school policies, processes and programmes that have enabled our pupils to learn meaningfully and deeply in and through the arts.
