### **Principal's Message**

<img src="/images/principal.png" style="width:25%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">
A Blessed New Year 2022 to you and your family! We would like to warmly welcome all our students back to school for the new academic year. We would like to especially welcome our new Primary 1 and K1 students, and new students and staff who have joined the MFPS family. We hope that you have had a restful and meaningful break with your family over the year-end school holidays.

We would like to thank Mrs Lim-Chua Siow Ling for her leadership of MFPS for the last six years and we wish her all the best in her future endeavours. I am delighted to join the school on 15 December 2021, after having served as Principal at CHIJ (Our Lady Queen of Peace), Marymount Convent School and St. Anthony’s Primary School. I look forward to working with all my colleagues in the school to nurture our students to be **_Empowered Learners and Empathetic Leaders who will be Exemplary Students of Tomorrow._**

Our theme for 2022 is **_Persist – Do It!_**. This theme encapsulates the Mayflower Primary community’s striving and thriving spirit despite the uncertainties in the past 2 years. The COVID-19 situation is still very fluid, with many uncertainties brought about by the emergence of new diseases and variants that led to many school closures overseas, for fear of the uncontrolled spread amongst children in schools. We are thankful that with the strict measures in place, schools in Singapore have remained open and our children were able to continue their learning, either physically or online. Here in MFPS, we were able to provide different learning opportunities so that our students continue to benefit from transformed learning experiences and strengthened well-being to ensure that they continue learning and growing.

As we move towards the Covid-19 resilience phase as a nation, our theme calls on every member of the MFPS community – students, staff, parents – to persist and work towards our common goal of nurturing Empowered Learners and Empathetic Leaders in our children. We do this by embracing our learning dispositions, starting with our ability to persist. It is in the darkest skies that we see the stars. We believe in putting our best efforts until we reach our goal, even if we don’t succeed the first time. In doing so, we will be able to sail through the roughest seas and arrive at our intended outcomes.

I look forward to an exciting year ahead and the school’s move back to Avenue 5 in 2022.

Ms Cecilia Lim<br>
Principal
