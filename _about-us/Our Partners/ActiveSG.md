### **ActiveSG**
Mayflower Primary has collaborated with ActiveSG on many occasions under the School Sports Partnerships (SSP) Programme introduced by national sports agency Sport Singapore (SportSG).  The intent is to give our students exposure to multiple sports so as to nurture in them the love for sports while developing their skills to play multiple sports; thus setting a strong foundation for them to stay active and lead a healthier life.

  

MFPS students enjoyed the opportunity to participate in other sports besides those offered by the school as co-curricular activities (CCAs). Thanks to the SSP programme, our P4 and P6 students were able to learn tennis and floorball respectively. We are constantly working with ActiveSG to decide on sports that will both expose and enthuse further participation in sports.

Besides the SSP programme, the cordial partnership has enabled the school to book sports facilities from **ActiveSG** seamlessly. The school’s National Day Celebration cum Sports Carnival was held at the Yio Chu Kang Stadium and Indoor Sports Hall since 2017 as a result of this collaboration.

In addition, the school also worked with ActiveSG to curate tailored programmes for selected students in the Healthy Me Programme.
