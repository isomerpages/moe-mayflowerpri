### **Yio Chu Kang Community Club**
Since 2016, MFPS has been engaged in active partnership with Yio Chu Kang Community Club (YCKCC) in bringing the Arts to the community. The partnership has evolved into an annual collaboration between MFPS CCA Art Club and residents in Yio Chu Kang in major art-making programmes under the PAssionArts Festival organised by the People’s Association (PA). 

Through this collaboration, our students are provided with a sense of purpose in their lifelong learning journey in contributing back to the community as concerned and gracious citizens through visual arts. This in turn also develops their confidence and competence in their knowledge and skills in art-making via interacting with community artists, teachers and peers.
