### **Triple P@MFPS**
Mayflower Primary School has partnered the Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWOs), Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and come on-board the evidence-based parenting programme, Positive Parenting Programme **(Triple P)**.

The programme equips parents with simple and practical strategies to help them confidently manage and support their children, prevent problems developing and build strong, healthy relationships. The techniques learnt and applied by parents, enhance children’s psychological, social and emotional competencies and increase parenting capability, reduce their stress and better connect with their children. This eventually helps in nurturing and developing the young ones into respectful, responsible and resilient citizens of Singapore.
