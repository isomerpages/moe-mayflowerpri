### **MFPS Alumni**
Mayflower Primary School’s Alumni was formed with the goal of reaching out to and engaging all MFPS alumni to foster valuable relationships and interaction among themselves and to promote a true spirit of loyalty by supporting the school in its programmes.

#### **Our Class of 1979 ~ MFPS’ First Cohort**
Our 1979 alumni contributed to the school for our 40th anniversary celebrations by giving a one-time bursary to our students from modest backgrounds who have made significant improvement in their schoolwork in the year 2019 and demonstrated positive learning attitudes and dispositions. This award was named in honour of their Mathematics teacher, Mr Low Kim Suan.

**Talks for Primary 6 students**<br>
To help students manage change from primary to secondary school, alumni members share personal stories on how they coped with the transition and overcame the challenges faced. They provide tips on how to integrate into the new environment and skills that are needed to pursue one’s interests. This sharing is conducted annually during the Education Fair for the Primary 5 and 6 students.
