### **NLB Read@School Programme**

#### **MRL’s Partnership with NLB for the InspiREAD Programme**

The **InspiREAD Programme** is a school-wide reading programme initiated to promote and cultivate a love for reading as a lifelong habit in all students. Through the programme, students are provided with a conducive reading space which has been created for them. Students are introduced to a variety of quality books and interesting reading activities to broaden their minds and ignite the joy of learning.

To achieve these objectives, the school’s Media Resource Library (MRL) committee collaborates closely with the National Library Board (NLB) through their Read@School initiative to promote reading among students in school. Through this initiative, students can enjoy a variety of exciting reading programmes that cater to their reading abilities and interests.

| NLB Read@School Programme | Programme Description | Levels |
|---|---|---|
| **Storytelling** | These assembly sessions can feature folktales, draw-and-tell stories, storigami and sing-alongs. | P1 – P3 |
| **Book Buzz** | These assembly talks will introduce students to current reading trends and good reads. | P4 – P6 |
| **Books2Go** | This is NLB’s mobile library where a wide variety of books is brought to schools for students to browse and borrow on the spot. Students can also approach the NLB librarians for book recommendations. | All levels |
| **Librarian’s Challenge** | This is a learning journey to the public library where students will be introduced to the rich collection of books, NLB eResources and other NLB services through a self-guided tour. | P1 |
| **POSB-NLB Kids’ Lit Quiz** | This is an annual international literature competition where students pit their wits against one another to answer questions on children’s books ranging from classics to comics. | P4 – P6 Selected students |

It is with hope that these programmes will provide students with a wider exposure to reading and enhance the overall reading experience to become a more meaningful and fun one.
