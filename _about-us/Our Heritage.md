#### **Our History**
##### **The Early Days 1979-1989**

<img src="/images/our%20heritage%201.jpg" style="width:35%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">
Mayflower Primary School was established on 2 January 1979 with 56 classes, 77 teachers and 2,395 pupils. It was then located at 20 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 and named after the old Mayflower Estate that once stood there. The school functioned in two sessions, sharing its premises with Ang Mo Kio Primary School. In July 1980 the school was officially opened by Mr Yeo Toon Chia, then Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio.

Under Madam Chua Soo Huang (1979-1984), the school crest and uniform were designed. With the help of Mr Seah Lye Huat, a PE Inspector, and Mr Leong Yoon Pin from CCAC (Co-Curricular Activities Centre), the words and lyrics for the school song were written.

Mr George Goh Yong Chua (1984-1988) did much to foster camaraderie amongst his staff and under his tenure, staff developed a strong sense of belonging to Mayflower Primary School. Through Mr Goh’s four and half years of active and dedicated leadership, he has left a symbolic spirit for the staff and pupils to emulate. Much credit is owed to these two pioneer principals for establishing the school in her initial years.

##### **Expansion 1989-1999**

Mrs Mary Lim took over as principal in 1989 and remained at the helm until 1996. In 1993 , Mayflower Primary School took over the entire building that it had up till then shared with Ang Mo Kio Primary School, dissolved its two-session structure and became a single session school. However, this change was short lived as enrollment increased dramatically shortly after the move, driving the school to once again offer two sessions.

##### **Mayflower Today 2000-to date**

On 11 March 2000, Mayflower Primary School moved to a brand new school at 200 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, its present location. Deputy Prime Minister, Brigadier-General Lee Hsien Loong, Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio, officially opened the school on 17 July 2000. Mayflower Primary School’s move to its current locale was the first to be implemented under the Ministry of Education’s Programme for the Rebuilding and Improvement of Existing Schools (PRIME).The new school was by all accounts a major improvement from the old school. Built upwards to maximize space, the new school comprised classrooms and facilities spread out over several floors divided into three blocks.

Over the decades, the school has not only grown in size, but its students were becoming accomplished in their own fields of study. In 2003, Mayflower Primary School celebrated its 24th anniversary by staging a variety show involving many of its talented students and staff. In 2010, the school celebrated its 31st anniversary in conjunction with the inaugural 2010 Summer Youth Olympics Games that was held in Singapore. An original batik painting was co-created by students and staff for the Games, depicting all the different participating nations. 

In 2015, Mayflower Primary School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in the “Development of Character, Citizenship and 21-century Competencies in and through the Arts”. The programme builds on the strengths of the school in providing quality arts education for all students, and in developing their interests and talents in visual arts and drama through its vibrant curricular and co-curricular activities.

On 15 December 2015, Mrs Lim-Chua Siow Ling was appointed the Principal or Mayflower Primary School. She would be the 8th officially appointed Principal of the school.

In 2018, Mayflower Primary School became the first designated mainstream primary school in Singapore for students with Hearing Loss (HL) who use sign language as the main mode of communication to access the national curriculum. The co-teaching model, which supports an inclusive education where students with HL learn alongside their hearing classmates, is adopted in our school.  

The Traits of MFPS students – **Empowered Learners and Empathetic Leaders** – was first introduced to the school community in 2018. The Traits of MFPS Students represent the collective hopes and aspirations stakeholders have of all our students. They delineate the distinctive attributes we want our students to be endowed with and support our vision of our students who are “Exemplary Citizens of Tomorrow”. They help us and our students understand what it means to live up to the vision of the school.  

In November 2019, STEM@MFPS was approved as an Applied Learning Programme. This is a customised 4-year enrichment programme that focuses on the principles of STEM. In this programme, our students innovate through solving real world problems and creating prototypes. Students are taught basic programming, computational and design thinking skills and learn through exploration by engaging in direct application of these skills, theories and models in an inter-disciplinary environment. Through such opportunities and engagement, we hope to lay a foundation for our students to be equipped with the broad pre-requisites for the future, namely innovation and creativity.  

To mark the school’s 40th Anniversary on 16 November 2019, the school was also presented with a certificate from the Singapore Book of Records for the **“Largest Ship Sculpture with Handpainted Sails”.** The 7 sails on the lifesize model ship was made of 1040 fabric patches created by staff, students, alumni, parents, SAC members and partners of the school. The patchwork art covered a total area of 30 square metres.

Mayflower Primary School is undergoing PERI upgrading, which will be completed in 2021. The Ministry of Education Kindergarten @ Mayflower is slated to start operations in 2021. With these exciting developments, the school will continue to thrive – nurturing future-ready students who will grow into exemplary citizens of tomorrow, passionate lifelong learners and positive change agents.
