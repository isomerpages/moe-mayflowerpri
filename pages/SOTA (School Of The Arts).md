### **SOTA (School of the Arts)**
Since 2019, the school has been working with SOTA in a Tier 2+ modular programme as part of the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP). The purpose is to shape the school’s LLP in order to provide students with opportunities for authentic learning of Drama and to facilitate the discovery of their interests and strengths in Drama whilst exposing them to the available relevant post-primary educational pathways such as DSA. The partnership also looks at the possibility of expanding teacher capacity through professional development opportunities. 

To develop students in a Tier 2+ Programme via Drama Club CCA, SOTA provides the school with support in enhancing the learning and development of students with a keen interest in Drama. SOTA provides students with training in specific Drama Skills not currently provided in the school’s Drama Club CCA programme such as. Playwriting Workshops, Technical aspects of Drama as well as acting/devising skills not covered in CCA; as well as incorporating a learning journey to SOTA’s theatre spaces / black box during the course of the module.  This will enable the students to be more equipped for post-primary Drama education possibilities such as DSA. 

To expand teacher capacity, SOTA is also open to the possibility of providing untrained Drama PAL and Drama CCA teachers with professional development (PD) workshops conducted by their seasoned practitioners and Drama educators.
