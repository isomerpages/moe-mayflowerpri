### **Learning for Life Programme @ MFPS**
##### **Introduction**
LLP@MFPS: Development of Character, Values, Citizenship and 21CC through the Arts is a customised programme to enable students to develop and deepen the acquisition of knowledge, skills, learning dispositions and values through Visual Arts and Drama.

At MFPS, we believe the Arts positively mould and impact the development of students’ Character, Citizenship and 21st Century Competencies to be passionate, lifelong learners. It encourages students to communicate ideas, explore perspectives, express with confidence, work in teams and develop creativity. We want the Arts to be accessible to all students and provide them with enriched learning experiences, anchored on our arts education philosophy that every student can learn and express themselves through the Arts

LLP@MFPS offers a range of age-appropriate developmental opportunities for all students from at least two levels in Visual Arts and Drama.

##### **Objective**
The vision for Arts Education in MFPS is that every student has the opportunity
* To learn through the arts, namely Visual Arts and Drama 
* To discover and develop their interests, strengths and talents 
* To develop character and values

#### **The Programme**
**Drama -**&nbsp;Development through Drama is a programme that uses Drama in Education as an alternative pedagogy in providing access to a contextualized, creative and engaging mode of learning and acquiring the English Language through a Process Drama approach.

The Development through Drama Programme enables all primary 1 and 2 students to gain exposure to Drama skills for one term with the objective of developing confident students with positive social and interaction skills. Through this programme, students will also develop listening, reading and communication skills through their exposure to drama skills where opportunities are created for students to “Make”, “Present” and “Respond”.

The school also partners SOTA to provide MFPS students with opportunities for authentic learning of Drama skills to further develop interested and talented students in this art form. Through this partnership, SOTA will also look out for potential students to articulate into the institution via SOTA’s Junior Academy Programme.

**Visual Arts -** The overall approach to engage our students in Visual Arts is through Museum-Based Learning (MBL). MBL is a pedagogical approach that uses places and their resources as a foundation for learning across subject disciplines. MBL connects learning to places and communities in and beyond school, in authentic and meaningful ways.

Below is an overview of the various programmes using the MBL approach for the following levels:

| Level | Programme | Activities |
|---|---|---|
| Primary 2 | The Traveling Museum | Performances and Exhibitions - School -based |
| Primary 3 | Singapore Philatelic Museum (SPM) | Visit SPM – onsite |
