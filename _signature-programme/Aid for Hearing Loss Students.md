### **Aid for Hearing Loss Students**
Mayflower Primary School (MFPS) is the first designated mainstream primary school in Singapore for students with Hearing Loss (HL) who sign. The school received our first cohort of students with HL in 2018 and these students use both Singapore Sign Language and English to access the national curriculum.

This inclusion aims to:
* enable students with HL who sign to be socially integrated; 
* allow students with HL who sign to be immersed in a language-rich environment which provides them with opportunities to learn to communicate and interact better with their peers; and 
* build empathy in our hearing students as they increase in their awareness and be more sensitive to the needs of their peers with HL.

MFPS recognises this as an empowering educational tool in which our students develop empathy for others. This is a core value and skill to be taught and caught for our students to grow into caring individuals and empathetic leaders of the future.

#### **The Co-Teaching Model**
As a step towards inclusivity, students with HL learn alongside their hearing classmates. In each of these classes, the co-teaching instructional approach is implemented. The mainstream Education Officer (EO) and the Specialised Teacher (SpT) of students with HL use a co-teaching model to differentiate and deliver instructions in the classroom.

This inclusive lesson-delivery model gives assurance that all the students with HL have full access to the grade-level expectations of the national curriculum in Singapore.

During lessons, the mainstream EO and the SpT of students with HL support their students in different ways. The EO is viewed as having the expertise in content, and the SpT is regarded as the one having expertise in research-based strategies and techniques to support the students with HL in their learning. The two educators work hand-in-hand in class to create an inclusive learning environment for all students in the classroom.

### **Social and Emotional Learning for All**

Students who share the same classroom environment as students with HL pick up Sign Language on their own and through incidental learning of being together.

This is beneficial to all students as acquiring a third language enables them to develop mental dexterity. Learning sign language requires both sides of the brain and gives their memory a good workout in the brain gym.

School is an exciting place to be when siblings attend school together. Alya (Pr 4) and Ayra  (Pr 1)  as well as Qyairah (Pr 4) and Qusyairi (P1) are siblings who are enrolled in the programme for students with HL. They are together in each other’s company and provide social-emotional support to one another in the daily rigour of life in school.

Seven-year-old Qusyairi says, “My sister keeps a watch over me especially when I am at play during recess. She showed me around the school on the first week of lessons. I felt confident and assured knowing that my sister is always here for
me!”

Ten-year-old Alya has a younger sister in Primary One too. She is proud to have her sister joining her in school.

Alya adds,” I make sure that my sister does not go astray or lose focus from studies. Just like me, she will work hard to make our parents proud that we are in a mainstream school. We have made many friends in school and will continue to share and care for everyone in the community in Mayflower Primary School.”
