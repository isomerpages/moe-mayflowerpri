### **Aid for Hearing Loss Students**
Mayflower Primary School (MFPS) is the first designated mainstream primary school in Singapore for students with Hearing Loss (HL) who sign. The school received our first cohort of students with HL in 2018 and these students use both Singapore Sign Language and English to access the national curriculum.

This inclusion aims to:
* enable students with HL who sign to be socially integrated; 
* allow students with HL who sign to be immersed in a language-rich environment which provides them with opportunities to learn to communicate and interact better with their peers; and 
* build empathy in our hearing students as they increase in their awareness and be more sensitive to the needs of their peers with HL.

MFPS recognises this as an empowering educational tool in which our students develop empathy for others. This is a core value and skill to be taught and caught for our students to grow into caring individuals and empathetic leaders of the future.

#### **The Co-Teaching Model**
As a step towards inclusivity, students with HL learn alongside their hearing classmates. In each of these classes, the co-teaching instructional approach is implemented. The mainstream Education Officer (EO) and the Specialised Teacher (SpT) of students with HL use a co-teaching model to differentiate and deliver instructions in the classroom.

This inclusive lesson-delivery model gives assurance that all the students with HL have full access to the grade-level expectations of the national curriculum in Singapore.

During lessons, the mainstream EO and the SpT of students with HL support their students in different ways. The EO is viewed as having the expertise in content, and the SpT is regarded as the one having expertise in research-based strategies and techniques to support the students with HL in their learning. The two educators work hand-in-hand in class to create an inclusive learning environment for all students in the classroom.
