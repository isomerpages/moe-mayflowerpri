### **Applied Learning Programme (STEM@MFPS)**
#### **Introduction**
At Mayflower, we endeavour to deliver a high quality and coherent STEM education to our students.  STEM@MFPS is achieved through a customised 4-year enrichment programme that focuses on the principles of STEM. In this programme, our students innovate through solving real world problems and creating prototypes.

Students are taught basic programming, computational and design thinking skills.  Students learn through exploration by engaging in direct application of these skills, theories and models in an inter-disciplinary environment.  Through such opportunities and engagement, we hope to lay a foundation that will serve as a natural pathway for our students to be equipped with the broad pre-requisites for the future, namely innovation and creativity.

#### **Objectives**
Aligned to our school’s defined traits of MFPS students: Empowered Learners and Empathetic Leaders, we hope that our students will be equipped with 21st century competency skills such as:

* having the curiosity to explore, experiment and innovate
* being resilient through multiple trials and errors
* being empathetic problem solvers
* being responsible citizens
* being equipped with basic computational and critical thinking skills
* understanding the spirit of learning and unlearning (through coding and engineering) and
* having a deeper understanding of how things work around them
