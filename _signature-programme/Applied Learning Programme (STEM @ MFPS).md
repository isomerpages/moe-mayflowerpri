### **Applied Learning Programme (STEM@MFPS)**
#### **Introduction**
At Mayflower, we endeavour to deliver a high quality and coherent STEM education to our students.  STEM@MFPS is achieved through a customised 4-year enrichment programme that focuses on the principles of STEM. In this programme, our students innovate through solving real world problems and creating prototypes.

Students are taught basic programming, computational and design thinking skills.  Students learn through exploration by engaging in direct application of these skills, theories and models in an inter-disciplinary environment.  Through such opportunities and engagement, we hope to lay a foundation that will serve as a natural pathway for our students to be equipped with the broad pre-requisites for the future, namely innovation and creativity.

#### **Objectives**
Aligned to our school’s defined traits of MFPS students: Empowered Learners and Empathetic Leaders, we hope that our students will be equipped with 21st century competency skills such as:

* having the curiosity to explore, experiment and innovate
* being resilient through multiple trials and errors
* being empathetic problem solvers
* being responsible citizens
* being equipped with basic computational and critical thinking skills
* understanding the spirit of learning and unlearning (through coding and engineering) and
* having a deeper understanding of how things work around them

#### **The Curriculum**
##### **Experiential Learning**
In designing the curriculum, the element of experiential learning is intentionally infused into the curriculum so that students learn through fun and hands-on exploration.

Primary 3 and 4 students are immersed in technology-enhanced block-based toys such as LEGO to evoke their imagination and creativity as they acquire spatial and planning skills.  Primary 5 and 6 students are taught using technology-enhanced toys such as SAM LABS that offers endless opportunities for students to innovate.

##### **Connection to the real world**
At every level, students will have the opportunity to apply what they have learnt to authentic contexts that they are familiar with.

At the lower primary ALP stage, the Primary 3 students focus on mastering basic computational skills through the basic WeDo Programming.  Students are engaged in applied learning through direct application of these skills in simple robotic models like the Milo Rover for the exploration of inhabitable places or a simple machine used to clean up polluted waters. Hence, the ALP serves as a platform to ignite students’ curiosity on how technology can be embedded in robots to do work.

At the upper primary ALP stage, Primary 4 students are taught the Scratch Programming while the Primary 5 and 6 students, the more advanced flow programming to solve problems faced within their community.  Students are also exposed to basic design thinking process to help them develop problem-solving skills, with the element of taking perspectives.  Students work collaboratively in teams to brainstorm, design and prototype their chosen solutions.

##### **Field Work**
One of the most distinctive feature of our ALP programme is the field work.  Students conduct practical work in their learning environment and the community to research and investigate problems around them. Practical work include collecting information through observation and conducting interviews.  The field work is an important component of the students’ learning process as they learn how to negotiate with their interviewees, relate to them and to think on their feet on the next course of action to take to complete their investigation.
