### **Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)**
The MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) provides financial assistance to Singaporean students who need financial assistance for their studies. Students who are eligible for the MOE FAS should apply and those currently under this scheme would not be automatically considered unless a fresh application is submitted. 

Applications forms are available from the School's General Office and school website. The closing date for the submission of MOE FAS 2023 application is 31 October 2022. 

From 2023, the income eligibility criteria for the above scheme will be revised as follows:

| Scheme |  Current Income Eligibility Criteria |  Revised Income Eligibility Criteria |
|---|---|---|
|  MOE FAS (From 1 Jan 2023) |  GHI ≤ $2,750 or PCI ≤ $690 |  GHI ≤ $3,000 or PCI ≤ $750 |
|

MOE has rolled out e-FAS for the 2023 MOE FAS application. Parents have the option to submit either a hardcopy or softcopy FAS application.
