### **School Community Art**
MFPS Patchwork is a collaborative artwork that showcases a unique collection of fond memories, dreams and aspirations of our Mayflower community, comprising of pioneers from the class of 1979 until the present staff and stakeholders. Over 1000 pieces of interesting illustrations were used to form the magnificent series of sails of the&nbsp;_**Mayflower Ship Sculpture**._

The school worked with the students and stakeholders to contribute an art piece (patchwork) each to represent a memory of either the past, present or future hopes for the school.

All students have contributed their art pieces during Art lessons in Term 2, together with staff (past and present), alumni members and parents.

The pieces of fabric, with the visuals, would then be collated, stitched and pieced to be a sail of our Mayflower ship which will be displayed at the school foyer in Term 3.
