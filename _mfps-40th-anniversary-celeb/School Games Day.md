### **School Games Day**
Games Day this year was held with the theme – “Our School, Our Singapore”, where we celebrated our school’s 40th anniversary and the Nation’s 200th year since the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles.

The students were brought through a sporting experience through the times, where they participated in games that were played in the past and games in the present. Games that employed the use of technology were also included to suggest how games in the future might be played.

The school was grouped according to their class values (Commitment, Excellence, Integrity), where the points gained by each class would be tabulated across all levels. As such, students spent their PE lessons learning and practicing the games that would be played. This was so that they may have a chance to win the Challenge Shield, which was awarded to the group with most points scored.

We could see that students put in their best efforts in every segment of the games (Past, Present and Future segments) in order to best their opponents. It was a proud moment to award the winning groups for scoring the most points. The Olympic spirit of Respect, Friendship and Excellence was clearly displayed through the students’ participation in the games. It was a fun and wholesome experience for them to experience the different games played through the generations of our nation.
