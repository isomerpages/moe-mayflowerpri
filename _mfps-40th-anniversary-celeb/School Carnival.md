### **School Carnival**

On Saturday, 16 November 2019, we had our very own school carnival, Mayflower Fiesta – A Family Celebration, to mark the school’s 40th anniversary celebrations. Apart from celebrating this significant milestone, the fiesta also served as a platform for our staff and students to exemplify the school motto of Service before Self as they thought of ways to contribute meaningfully to the larger community in a collective fundraising effort.

In previous years, the fundraising event was organised solely by the Primary 6 students in the form of a mini Fun(d) Fair as part of their Values-in-Action (VIA) Project. This year, however, all levels came on board to raise funds for four beneficiaries, namely Children’s Cancer Foundation (CCF), Lions Befrienders Service Association (Singapore), TOUCH Silent Club (TSC) and NTUC Health Nursing Home.

Our various stakeholders, which include the Mayflower Primary School Alumni, Mayflower Parent Support Group (PSG), School Advisory Committee (SAC) and other school partners also rendered their assistance to the fiesta, further exemplifying our school motto. Family members and friends of MFPS students and former MFPS school leaders and staff joined us in this joyous occasion as well.

This celebration enabled every student to exemplify the traits of a MFPS student, specifically that of an Empowered Learner, where they took ownership of the Fiesta by taking the initiative to plan for their own class booths and working together to turn their creative ideas into reality.

There were many exciting game booths such as bouncing castles, mini archery, an obstacle course, an escape room and many more. Many eager participants worked hard to earn stamps at the various booths so that they could redeem the attractive prizes. Students also collaborated with one another by pooling their funfair coupons together in order to dunk the school leaders and teachers at the dunking machine. Loud cheers and enthusiastic applause erupted each time the target was successfully ‘dunked’ into the water. The slime making workshop, organised by the Primary 2 level, was especially a hit as students got to make and personalise their very own slime.

It was indeed a memorable day for all present at the fiesta. The hard work of all staff and students paid off with the successful turnout at the event and the smiles on everyone’s faces as they came together to celebrate and do their part for the community.
