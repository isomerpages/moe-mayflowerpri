### **Volleyball**

Volleyball is a CCA that aims to create a FUN learning environment for boys and girls of differing abilities to participate in the sport. This CCA strives to develop students into reflective players and helps each student to develop a growth mindset in game and off game. We aim to create an atmosphere of togetherness as students overcome various challenges and difficulties as a team.&nbsp;
  
We achieve this by ensuring that students have a reachable long-term goal for every training season through organizing key milestone events like friendly matches, sending them for exchanges and participating in various competitions, especially the National School Games. We also collaborate with learning institutions of various levels so that our students can have a wider exposure to different playing styles and possible future education paths.
