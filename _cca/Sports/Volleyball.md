### **Volleyball**

Volleyball is a CCA that aims to create a fun learning environment for boys and girls of differing abilities to participate in the sport. The CCA strives to develop students into reflective players and helps each student to develop a growth mindset in game and off game.

We achieve this by ensuring that students have a reachable long-term goal for every training season through organizing friendly matches, sending them for exchanges and participating in competitions. We also collaborate with learning institutions of various levels so that our students can have a wider exposure to different playing styles and possible future education paths.

Our current training structure is as follows:

**Mondays:  2 pm to 3:45 pm** (Competition Team only)<br>
**Friday Morning: 7:45 am to 9:30 am** (Entire Volleyball Team)<br>
**Friday Afternoons: 2 pm to 3:30 pm** (Supplementary Practice for new members)
