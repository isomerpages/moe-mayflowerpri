### **Taekwando**
Our mission is to bring out the best in our Taekwondo members in terms of self-defence, self-discipline and fitness as they prepare for their grading test or competition. 

Technique, co-ordination and concentration are key in this ancient Korean fighting art, which received its official name Taekwondo (tae meaning kick with feet, kwon meaning destroying with hands and do meaning art) in 1955. 

Mayflower Primary School’s Taekwondo Club started in 2002. Students in this club learn discipline, respect and fitness training while mastering the basic kicks and training for the different levels represented by different coloured belts. Members who show potential are selected to represent our school in the National School Games and other competitions.

We train once a week, on Fridays, from 8.00 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. Emphasis on training is towards self defense and pattern movements, not the more aggressive sparring. It is hoped that the pupils will learn the basics and go on to pursue the more advanced skills in Secondary School.
