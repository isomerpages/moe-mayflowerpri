### **Taekwando**
Our mission is to bring out the best in our Taekwondo members in terms of self-defence, self-discipline and fitness as they prepare for their grading test or competition. Technique, co-ordination and concentration are key in this ancient Korean fighting art, which received its official name Taekwondo (tae meaning kick with feet, kwon meaning destroying with hands and do meaning art) in 1955. 

Mayflower Primary Schoolâ€™s Taekwondo CCA started in 2002. Students in this CCA learn discipline, respect and fitness training while mastering the basic kicks and training for the different levels represented by different coloured belts. Members who show potential are selected to represent our school in the National School Games and other competitions.

 We train at least once a week, with emphasis on self-defense and pattern movements, rather than sparring. It is hoped that students will learn the basics and go on to pursue more advanced skills in Secondary School
