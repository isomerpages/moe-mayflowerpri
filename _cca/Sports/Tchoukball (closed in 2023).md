### **Tchouckball**
**(Will be closed in 2023)**<br>
We aim to nurture and maximise the potential of every member in Tchoukball. Members will learn a variety of Tchoukball skills, strategies and tactics. They will acquire the basics of footwork, ball-handling skills and positional play in an environment where teamwork and co-operation is a requirement.

Tchoukball is a team sport that focuses on Respect, Excellence and Friendship. Tchoukball is also a team sport with Sportsmanship as its foundation.

The CCA will be closed at the end of this year. We thank all past and current students for their efforts towards this CCA.
