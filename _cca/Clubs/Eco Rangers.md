### **Eco Rangers**

Environmental issues are becoming increasingly important worldwide and we have a duty to do our bit to protect our future by being as 'green' as possible. As we develop as a nation, we must realise the impact we have on the environment and what we can do to keep carbon emissions to a minimum. Just as we have a duty to implement sustainable solutions, we also have duty to pass on this important lesson to the next generation (our students), so that they do not make the same mistakes we have made. Each student will take responsibility for his or her action which can affect the environment.&nbsp;

By adapting our actions accordingly, we do our share to save the planet and protect the environment. Our Eco Rangers Club aims to inculcate in our students the school core values, learning dispositions and 21st CC skills through fun and enjoyable activities, projects and competitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Students will be presented with a variety of environmental issues and they will have to do research, reflect and put their values in action by presenting the information, their thoughts and views on various platforms. Students will focus on an environment theme each term in groups. In addition, every student will be given a Young Scientist Environmentalist Card to complete. Individual students who have earned at least 15 stars will be awarded with a Young Scientist Environmentalist badge.
