### **Eco Rangers**
Environmental issues are becoming increasingly important worldwide and we have a duty to do our bit to protect our future by being as 'green' as possible. As we mature as a nation, we must realise the impact we have on the environment and what we can do to keep carbon emissions to a minimum. Just as we have a duty to implement sustainable solutions, we also have a duty to pass this important message to the next generation - our students. 

By adapting our actions accordingly, we do our share to save the planet and protect the environment. Our Eco Rangers Club aims to give opportunities to its member to participate in activities that allow them to exemplify themselves as Empowered Learners and Empathetic Leaders. The fun and enjoyable activities, projects and competitions provide a platform for the Rangers to be engaged firsthand in raising environmental awareness in school and at home. 

This year, the Eco Ranger Club actively promoted World Water Day in school. A deck of slides prepared by the Rangers was shared in class during the pre-Assembly session. Staff came to school decked in blue on 22 March in support of the water cause - an initiative of Singapore’s National Water Agency, PUB, - #GoBlue4SG Movement.
