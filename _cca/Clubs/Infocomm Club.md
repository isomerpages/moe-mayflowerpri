### **Infocomm Club**
The Infocomm Club aims to excite students about technology in a fun and meaningful way through skills such as photography, videography, animation and programming. The club aims to cultivate leadership and entrepreneurship at an early age and equip students with the necessary skills in this digital age.Â 

We also aim to provide our students with opportunities to express creativity as well as promote community spirit.
