### **Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)**
**Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)** provide a platform for students to develop in the areas of moral, cognitive, social-emotional, physical and aesthetic domains.  Our Co-Curriculum Activities provide students with platforms to discover their interests and talents through active participation. This will help students develop a life-long love for an activity, be it in Sports or in the Arts. Through CCA, our students will develop 21st Century Competencies, as they will get the opportunity to demonstrate values and behavior such as fair play, team spirit, leadership skills and discipline.

Experiential Learning is the main mode of delivery in CCAs and this provides real world context for students to apply their learning.

In Mayflower Primary School, we have diverse CCA options for students to explore as our CCAs cover four broad groups:

* **[Aesthetics (Performing and Visual arts)](https://staging.dumgjq4ikmf5k.amplifyapp.com/holistic-education/cca/aesthetics/)**
