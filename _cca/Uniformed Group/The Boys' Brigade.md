### **The Boys' Brigade**

Sir William Alexander Smith conceived the Boys’ Brigade (BB) in 1883. Incepted in Glasgow, the Boys’ Brigade quickly spread across the United Kingdom by the early 1890s. James Milner Fraser, founder of BB in Singapore, was a member of the 23rd Aberdeen Company and an officer in the 23rd London Company. Together with SGT Quek Eng Moh, they founded the first Singapore Company at Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church on 12th January 1930. After more than 80 years since its inception in Singapore, Boys’ Brigade Singapore has more than 7000 officers and Boys. There are 114 BB Companies.

**The BB motto is “Sure and Steadfast”.** Within the BB emblem, lies an anchor that reminds the boys of the need to stay grounded in whichever task they perform. BB aims to promote in our members the habits of obedience, reverence, discipline and self-respect.
