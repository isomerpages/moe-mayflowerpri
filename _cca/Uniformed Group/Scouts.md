### **Scouts**
The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where each member will extend help to others and play a constructive role in society.

**This is achieved by:**<br>
1.  Involving MFPS Cub Scouts throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational process;<br>
2.  Using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed person.<br>
3.  Assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social and personal principles as expressed in the Promise and Law

**Our MFPS Cub Scouts** undergo a basic development programme that spiral upwards progressively as they advance in the values of Scouting. They will participate in camps and carry out self-directed learning to earn proficiency badges throughout their journey as an MFPS Cub Scout.

**The Frank Cooper Sands Award (FCSA)** is an award given yearly to sectional scout units for unit excellence. In 2019, MFPS Cub Scouts received the FCSA (Bronze) award.
