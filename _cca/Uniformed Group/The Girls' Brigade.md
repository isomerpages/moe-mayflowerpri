### **The Girls' Brigade**
**The Girls' Brigade (GB)**, first established in Singapore in 1927, is an international, interdenominational Christian Youth Organisation for girls. The 57th Company started in 2003 here at Mayflower Primary School.

The Girls' Brigade serves also as a platform for girls to develop character and hone their leadership skills. The Girls’ Brigade at MFPS is committed to cultivating each girl into an empowered learner and empathetic leader.

Our activities include devotion, drill, badge-work and recreation games that focus and build teamwork. Our girls are grouped in squads to enable them to develop and interact with one another, forging new friendships.
