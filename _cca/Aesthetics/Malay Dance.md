### **Malay Dance**
The Malay Dance Programme provides a spectrum of experiences allowing our students to explore different rhythms and movements of Malay Dance. Our CCA has a buddy system for new members to take care of their well-being as well as allow the seniors to bond with the juniors.&nbsp; Through creating simple dance poses together in groups,&nbsp; &nbsp;Malay Dance members interact with each other as well as with their teachers. Through our dance CCA, students learn values such as resilience, respect and commitment to do their best.&nbsp;These are some of the essential values for character building.&nbsp;

Our students also gain insights into the richness of Malay culture and traditions. Primary 1 and 2 students who are interested in Malay Dance are given the opportunity to explore and experience new dance steps by participating in the Malay Dance Elective Programme that is available for students to sign up.
