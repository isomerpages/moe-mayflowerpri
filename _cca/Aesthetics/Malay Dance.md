### **Malay Dance**
The Malay Dance Programme provides a spectrum of experiences allowing our students to explore different rhythms and movements of Malay Dance. Our CCA has a buddy system for new members to take care of their well-being as well as allow seniors to bond with the juniors.&nbsp; Through creating simple dance poses together in groups, Malay Dance members interact with each other as well as with their teachers. Through our dance CCA, students learn values such as resilience, respect and commitment to do their best. These are some of the essential values for character building.&nbsp;Our students also gain insights into the richness of Malay culture and traditions.
