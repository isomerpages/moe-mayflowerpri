### **Indian Dance**
**Indian Dance**&nbsp;aims to groom and develop a pool of talented dancers for internal and external performances. We offer an enrichment Indian Dance programme for P1 and P2 students who are keen to learn Indian Dance. These programmes provide some basic dance skills as well as create an opportunity for them to perform during school events. Our Indian Dance members are committed to give their best in whatever they do and be confident and self-directed leaders who are resilient and show perseverance.
