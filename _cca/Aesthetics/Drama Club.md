### **Drama Club**
Drama Club aims to develop students’ passion and interest in the performing arts whilst simultaneously building their confidence in public speaking through imaginative and creative aesthetic performances. Skills such as articulation, public speaking and voice projection are taught and practised alongside theatre skills such as dramatisation, characterisation, role-play, improvisation, body awareness, movement, mime and theatrical skills.

Our talented members show great keenness in acting and have put up a number of entertaining skits for school assembly programmes and other school key events. We also reach out to the community through our annual public performances at the Ang Mo Kio Public Library. As part of our efforts to sharpen members’ Drama skills, Drama Club also collaborates with SOTA (School Of The Arts) theatre teachers in organising workshops on improvisation and scriptwriting skills for the members. This will help to develop the students’ skills in acting and understanding of scripts so that they will be more equipped for post-primary Drama education possibilities such as Direct School Admission (DSA).

Drama Club also contributes to talent development by ensuring that students who have potential in Theatre for DSA will be nominated for the yearly SOTA’s DSA platform : Talent Academy (Theatre). Through the various activities that the nominees take part in via Talent Academy, successful nominees will then be shortlisted for DSA.
