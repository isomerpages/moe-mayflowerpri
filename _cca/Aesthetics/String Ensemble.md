### **String Ensemble**
The String Ensemble consists of violin, cello and double bass players from Primary 3 to Primary 6. The String Ensemble aims to equip our students not only on the music technicalities in playing string instruments but also to nurture string members to be passionate and empowered musicians who are self-directed learners who take ownership of their learning and of their instruments

Through participating in this CCA, students’ also build their social awareness and relationship management skills. A common space is provided for friendships and opportunities for social integration within and outside of the school. Leadership skills are also taught to students for example, CCA leaders have been given responsibilities to help teachers guide the rest of the team members. Seniors are also told to help to guide the juniors when instructors are busy.

Our String Ensemble also builds students’ confidence and resilience. It takes a lot of courage to perform in front of an audience during a performance.  Students need to practice consistently without giving up, to master and perfect the piece of music for the performance and in the process develop resilience.

We seek to provide various platforms for our members to perform and showcase their talents.  Our String Ensemble perform for school events as well as take part in the biennial SYF Arts Presentation organized by Arts Education Branch.  Interested upper primary students who have the potential are encouraged to apply to SOTA or Secondary Schools offering DSA in this CCA.   

The String Ensemble welcomes interested P3 students to join our CCA. We also offer Violin / Cello Enrichment Classes for P1 and P2 students who are interested to learn to play a string instrument.
