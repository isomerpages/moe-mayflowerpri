### **Choir**
The Mayflower Primary School Choir aims to develop our members’ individual choral skills and technique to achieve a healthy choral tone. Through the choir practices, our choir members will develop individual confidence through expression and build on their listening skills to sing as one. Our choir members also learn to develop their dramatic performance skills through applying simple choreography into their musical performance. The MFPS Choir is under the baton of our choral director, Mr Marcus Lee.  

Apart from the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, the choir also actively participates in community events, such as performing at Sing Lah! 2019 at Our Tampines Hub and Voices in Harmony. Through these platforms, the choir hopes to hone their vocal production and showmanship skills. The choir hopes to share their love for singing through putting up performances for all to enjoy.
