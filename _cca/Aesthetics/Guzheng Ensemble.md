#### **Guzheng Ensemble**
Mayflower Primary Guzheng Ensemble started in 2006. Prior to this, it was a section in the Mayflower Primary School Chinese Orchestra.
  
Our instructors help our students to acquire a variety of skills specific to playing the instrument. Through our Guzheng CCA programme, we hope to help students achieve mastery as they learn to play beautiful pieces of music as well as develop a love for Chinese music. 
  
Guzheng emphasises teamwork and collaboration with teammates. Our students are encouraged to work with teammates to achieve perfection in their performances. 
  
Our Guzheng Ensemble also participates in numerous school and public performances. Through these performances, we create learning platforms to hone our students’ musical talents and 21st century competencies, while developing a deeper understanding and appreciation for Chinese culture.
