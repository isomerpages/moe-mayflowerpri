#### **Guzheng Ensemble**

Mayflower Primary Guzheng Ensemble started in 2006. Prior to this, it was a section in the Mayflower Primary School Chinese Orchestra.

Our instructors help our students to acquire a variety of skills specific to playing the instrument. They are also introduced to beautiful pieces of music. Through our Guzheng CCA programme, we hope to help students achieve mastery as they learn to play pieces of music on a new instrument as well as develop a love for Chinese music. 

Guzheng emphasises teamwork and collaboration with teammates. Our Guzheng Ensemble also participates in numerous school and public performances. Through these performances, we create learning platforms to hone our students’ musical talents and 21st century competencies, while developing a deeper understanding and appreciation for the Chinese culture. 

Guzheng CCA also provides an Elective Programme for Primary 1 and Primary 2 students to expose them to the learning of this instrument. This provides an opportunity for students to discover their talents.
