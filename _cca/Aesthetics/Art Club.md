### **Art Club**
**Principles for the Development of a Complete Mind: Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses – especially learn how to see. Realise that everything connects to everything else. — Leonardo da Vinci**

**MFPS Art Club**&nbsp;strives to develop our members to become empowered learners and empathetic leaders via learning in and through visual arts. We aim to cultivate empowered learners through our termly art modules that are choice-based and inquiry-based in nature. These interesting and fun modules require members to exercise active decision-making to express their voice with teacher guidance. These art projects are designed around the 3 fundamental learning domains in learning visual arts: see, express and appreciate, undergirded by 3 core big ideas in Art. These projects not only train members in acquiring art appreciation, art-making and art exhibition knowledge and skills, they also nurture members to see things with new perspectives, tell stories and make informed decisions in life through the study and exploration of art. Thus teaching our members to observe, analyze, explore, interact and make sense of the world around them.

Besides teaching knowledge and skills in Art, we also aspire to kindle the flame within each individual to empathize with others through their talent and passion. This is done by developing the skill of deep observation through artful thinking routines and Values in Action (VIA) programmes, developing our members into extraordinary leaders who possess 21st century skills, good character and values to positively serve and impact the community. MFPS Art Club has 3 annual VIA programmes which provide our members with opportunities to serve the community through Art. The Passion Arts Community Event with Yio Chu Kang CC, Collaborative Art-making Project with Pre-school children at kindergarten(s) and Partners Appreciation Events are large-scale projects, which present rich and deep learning for our members while they contribute to the community.

**Talent Identification and Development Education (TIDE)**&nbsp;is another major function of MFPS Art Club. Through close interaction and observation, Art Club teachers will identify interested and talented members for further development. Identified members will be guided to go deeper in the 3 learning domains to build a wider repertoire of knowledge and skills in preparation for specialized secondary education in Visual Arts. The members in this advance category often represent the school in national and international art competitions. Below is a modest list of awards /recognition achieved by our aspiring student-artists, serving as an encouragement and inspiration to others in the club.
