#### **CCA Registrations**
Towards the end of every year, P2 students will have to make a selection of 3 CCAs that they are interested in. They will be assigned a CCA out of their 3 choices. Please click/scan the QR Code below to indicate the CCA choices for 2022's P2 students:

#### **CCA Transfers**

While we encourage all students to continue in their chosen CCA from Primary 4 onwards, we understand that there may be circumstances that cause students to be unable to continue in a CCA. Should that situation arise, please click/scan the QR code below to request for a change in CCA. We will update your child/ward on the transfer outcome via the All-Ears platform or through a hardcopy notification. If the form is closed, it means that no transfers will be accepted in this point of time.
