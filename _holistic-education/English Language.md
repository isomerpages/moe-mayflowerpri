### **English Language**
#### **Learning Outcomes**
To equip our students with a strong foundation in literacy skills that will enable them to become linguistically competent and confident users of the English Language.

#### **Teaching Approaches**
*   Using systemic and explicit instruction to build a strong foundation in language skills, grammar, and vocabulary.
*   Adopting a contextualised and holistic approach to learning that provides a rich language environment and varied learning experiences for developing language skills. 
*   Using effective and engaging strategies that are developmentally appropriate to teach the critical life skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing in the English Language.
*   Providing platforms that focus on oral communication (listening and speaking skills) such as show-and-tell, dramatisation, and oral presentations for all levels.

#### **InspiREAD Reading Programme**
The InspiREAD Reading Programme is a school-wide reading programme initiated to promote and cultivate a love for reading as a lifelong habit in all students. Opportunities are created for students to read in and beyond the classroom, and they are introduced to a variety of quality books and interesting reading activities to broaden their minds and ignite the joy of learning.

Guest authors are also invited to the school on a termly basis to give school-wide assembly talks on their books and writing journey to inspire students to love reading and writing. The assembly talks are then followed by a highly-anticipated and well-received two-day book fair and interaction cum autograph session with the author at the canteen. 

In addition, the school’s Media Resource Library (MRL) committee collaborates closely with the National Library Board (NLB) through their Read@School initiative to promote reading amongst students. Through this initiative, students can enjoy a variety of exciting reading programmes that cater to their reading abilities and interests:
