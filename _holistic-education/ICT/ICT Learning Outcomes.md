#### **Learning Outcomes**
The ICT department seeks to actualise the nation’s call towards a SMART NATION by operationalising MOE’s 4th Masterplan (mp4) for ICT in Education and aligning them with the school’s Strategic Thrust (ST1): **Future-Ready Students**, Our Focus.

The ICT department adopts a **spiral approach** to the delivery of baseline ICT. Essential ICT skills such as touch-typing are revisited and built upon over time, noting progress of skills from the simpler to the more advanced
