#### **Learning Outcomes**
The ICT department seeks to actualise the nation’s call towards a SMART NATION by operationalising MOE’s 4th Masterplan (mp4) for ICT in Education and aligning them with the school’s Strategic Thrust (ST1): **Future-Ready Students**, Our Focus. 

Students will be nurtured as **Responsible Digital Learners** and empowered with the basic level of ICT knowledge, skills and values to thrive in our technology-driven society.

As stipulated in MOE’s Baseline ICT guide, primary students will be able to:

* Operate computers and applications in ICT-enabled learning environment
* Search for information and communicate over the internet
* Create a short document using a word processor
* Represent tables of information in word processors and spreadsheets
* Create a short presentation with multimedia elements
* Collect data using ICT tools

#### **Teaching Approaches**
The ICT department adopts a **spiral approach** to the delivery of baseline ICT. Essential ICT skills such as touch-typing are revisited and built upon over time, noting progress of skills from the simpler to the more advanced

#### **Department Programmes**
The ICT department collaborates with other departments to ensure the delivery of the baseline ICT cum New Media Literacy course.

Starting from 2023, Primary 1 students will learn touch typing, image manipulation in Microsoft Word application and how to use search engines as part of the ICT department’s collaboration with the English and Mother Tongue department’s Reading Programme. In addition, both Primary 1 and 2 students will be exposed to ICT tools such as Padlet, Garage Band and sound recording tools in the SLS, during Art and Music department programmes. 

All teachers will deliver the baseline ICT cum new media literacy course from Term 1 to Term 4. The table below presents a brief overview:
