### **Music**
Aligned with MOE’s General Music Programme syllabus, the MFPS Music Instructional Programme (MIP) delivers MOE’s five learning objectives (see table below) through exposing our students to various musical techniques / skills, voice and instrumental performances, improvisation, appreciation of different genres of music and creation of melodic and rhythmic ostinatos.

**Learning Outcomes of 2015 Syllabus: General Music Programme Primary /Secondary**

|  |  |
|---|---|
| Learning Outcomes 1 | Perform Music in both instrumental and vocal settings, individually and in groups |
| Learning Objective 2 | Create Music in both instrumental and vocal settings, individually and in groups |
| Learning Objective 3 | Listen and Respond to Music |
| Learning Objective 4 | Appreciate Music from local and global cultures |
| Learning Objective 5 | Understand Musical elements and concepts |
|

While the progressive development of musical techniques/skills (i.e. Accuracy, Tone, Expressiveness, Ensemble Playing) is key to our MIP, the MIP also seeks to nurture Critical Inventive Thinking through tasks such as improvisation and composition to hone their creativity.  

We expose our students to other cultures and perspectives through our repertoire of music pieces and songs. We teach our students teamwork through the experience of instrumental ensemble work, allowing them to experience in a tactile manner as they **work in teams**. In the 6-year curriculum, besides singing, students will learn various instruments such as Cajon, Ukulele and Recorder. Students will experience the music before their learning of musical concepts and they will then apply these musical concepts in their creation and analysis of the music. Students can showcase their interests and talents through lunchtime concerts in the school. Through the MIP, students who are interested in the performing arts will be encouraged to join the relevant CCAs.

#### **Talent Identification and Development Education**
MFPS Music Talent Identification and Development Education (MTIDE) aims to identify students who are interested and/or display high musical capability. 

Talent identification is mainly through our interaction with students during curriculum time (music Lessons), Performing Arts CCA (Choir, Guzheng and String Ensemble) and teacher/parent recommendations.

Development programmes for identified students are carried out via a few platforms:

*   Individual / small group songwriting workshops sessions after school for competitions. E.g. SYF Youth Station, school-based competitions.
