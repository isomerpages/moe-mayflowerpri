### **Physical Education**
The **Physical Education (PE) programme** aims to build a strong foundation for the development of broad-based physical competencies and opportunities for recreational participation as well as the development of 21st Century Competencies to better prepare our students to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world.

#### **Learning Outcomes**
The goals of PE serve as a guide in the development of an individual who is able to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. Each of these goals is equally important and they interact with others in a well-planned programme that addresses the knowledge, skills and values desired for every student. The goals are:

| Goals | Outcomes |
|---|---|
| **Goal 1:** | Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities. |
| **Goal 2:** |   Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities |
| **Goal 3:** |   Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment |
| **Goal 4:** |   Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences. |
| **Goal 5:** |   Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities. |
| **Goal 6:** |   Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life. |

##### **Teaching Approaches**

In Mayflower Primary School, we base our PE curriculum on the intent of movement education to apply the four movement concepts to the three domains of learning (cognitive, psychomotor, and affective) integrating with the watered down aspects of teaching games for understanding (TGfU). The four movement concepts of body; space; effort and relationships with objects, people, and the environment emphasize the need for students to know basic movement concepts and be able to perform basic movement patterns. Thus, it is imperative to foster motor success and to provide students with a basic skill set that builds their movement repertoire, allowing them to engage in various forms of games, sports, and other physical activities. As they progress, the application of certain aspects of the TGfU model elevate students’ understanding and enjoyment of the sports and games.

The PE learning experience in Mayflower helps the lower primary students to focus on the mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with the application of movement concepts. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary students progress on to the development of distinct skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, with skills and concepts application in sports and games.

#### **Key Programmes**
**SwimSafer**<br>
Swimming is one of the learning areas in the MOE PE syllabus for primary schools and the SwimSafer Programme is a national water safety programme introduced by the National Water Safety Council (NWSC) to teach swimming proficiency and water survival skills to children in a fun manner to minimize drowning incidences. 

To ensure maximum participation in the SwimSafer Programme, the school has scheduled swimming to be taught at the Primary Two level during curriculum time. Our objective is to help each and every child learn the basic swimming and water safety skills that will serve them throughout their lifetime.

The swimming lessons take place once a week for an hour. The students are grouped and instructed according to their level of proficiency so that all of them benefit from the programme.

The department organises the annual P4 outdoor adventure camp to provide students with hands-on learning experiences. Through the camp, we hope to<br>
a) allow students to develop the qualities of teamwork and cooperation by interacting and working with their peers; and <br>
b) experience adventure learning through challenging outdoor activities where they will build self-confidence and develop their character to become an Empowered Learner and Empathetic Leader.

<img src="/images/pe3.png" style="width:35%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">**Games Day**<br>The department organizes Games Day with a carnival-like atmosphere to promote a healthy lifestyle among staff and students through fun-filled healthy activities specially designed by our PE Department. The PE teachers will prepare the students prior to the actual day. To promote maximum participation, a challenge shield will be presented to the lower and upper primary respectively at the end of the Games Day. 

An overall Challenge Shield will also be presented to the ‘Values’ house which the students represent. It is also a good platform for students to practise the school core values and exhibit the traits of an Empowered Learner and Empathetic Leader.

This programme allows identified students to learn about healthy eating habits and the importance of exercise. During the sessions, these students are taught skills like tracking their healthy lifestyle and performing simple workouts as well as desired values such as resilience and discipline. These skills and values are essential building blocks for them to lead a healthier lifestyle that would benefit their mind and body.

The objectives of the camp are to engage students in their sporting experience as well as enhance their role as a leader. The camp also provides former sports CCA leaders who have graduated, the opportunities to serve the school by sharing their experience and facilitating the camp which is in alignment with our school motto of Service before Self.

**Holistic Sports Programme**<br>
As part of our effort to promote the Joy of Learning through a robust and holistic school curriculum, the school collaborated with ActiveSG to map out a series of programmes/activities such as tennis, floorball, air badminton and gymnastics under this holistic curriculum. These programmes/activities will be held in Term 1 and Term 4 in place of the usual Supplementary /Remedial lessons held every Tuesdays and Thursdays
