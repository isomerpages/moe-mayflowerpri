### **Character and Citizenship Education**
#### **Learning Outcomes**
We believe that every child can be empowered to learn, serve and succeed in a caring and inclusive culture.

Our students will be:
* engaged learners who are motivated, self-directed and anchored in purpose and values; and
* concerned citizens who have a strong sense of belonging and school pride to lead and serve school and community.

Our curriculum and programme development is guided by our Level Outcomes. By the end of their 6-year education in Mayflower Primary School, students would have inculcated sound moral values, emotional competencies and positive learning dispositions that will guide them towards becoming Empowered Learners and Empathetic Leaders.

|  | Level Outcomes | Domains |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| Pr 1 | Positive & Confident Individual Students who are responsible for their own well-being. | Self |
| Pr 2 | Respectful & Caring Individual Students who are appreciative and empathise with others (peers & family). | Peers/Family |
| Pr 3 | Resilient Individual Students who show determination to face challenges and changes for the benefit of self and others. | School |
| Pr 4 | Morally Upright Individual Students who contribute to the well-being of others by making morally upright decisions. | Community (Neighbourhood) |
| Pr 5 | Concerned Individual Students who take initiative to improve the well-being of others. | Nation (beyond community) |

#### **Teaching Approaches**
In Mayflower Primary, we use the ExCITE approach to guide our CCE programme. This approach is anchored on the school mission, vision, values, motto and Traits of an MFPS student (Empowered Learner and Empathetic Leader).

**How the ExCITE Approach Looks Like**

|  |  |
|---|---|
| Expose | Explicit teaching of values and traits during ExCitE! Curriculum and across total curriculum<br> |
| Celebrate | Affirmation programmes such as ‘Caught Being Good’ and ‘Model Student Award’ are recognition platforms for students who exemplify School Values, Traits of an MFPS Student and positive Learning Dispositions<br> |
| Internalise | Platforms and opportunities given for students to think about what has been taught <br> |
| Transform | Time for inner dialogue and reflection, when students reflect on how they have been Empowered Learners and Empathetic Leaders, and how they can embody the traits better<br> |
| Exemplify | Application of values and traits in the way the students choose to carry themselves and make responsible decisions |
|

#### **Department Programmes**
**ExCitE! Curriculum (Form Teacher Guidance Period)**<br>
The Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) serves as a platform for form teachers to build positive relationships with their students. Form teachers enact the ExCitE! (Exemplary Citizens Every Day) curriculum, which focuses on explicit teaching of values, Social Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies, and Learning Dispositions.

Termly themes based on the Traits of MFPS Students guide the focus of our **ExCitE!** curriculum.

| Term | Themes |
|---|---|
| 1 | Passionate Learners, Gracious Leaders |
| 2 | Resilient Learners, Caring Leaders |
| 3 | Collaborative Learners, Proactive Leaders |
| 4 | Empowered Learners, Empathetic Leaders |
|

Students acquire the skills, knowledge, competencies and values through strategies that help them process their learning rather than being told explicitly by the teachers what is right or wrong. Interesting stories and relevant articles are used to provide students with examples of positive traits in action.

Through activities like role-playing and games, students have the opportunity to observe both positive and negative behaviour from different perspectives. Follow-up discussions allow them to listen to other people’s perspectives and reflect on their own thoughts.

Through their active participation, students learn and internalise these values, skills, knowledge and competencies. The values taught are further reinforced during instructional and non-instructional programmes, co-curricular activities (CCAs) and enrichment activities. Opportunities that arise incidentally are also used to teach or reinforce the learning of these competencies and values in students.

**Assembly Programme**<br>
Assembly programmes are an additional platform where our students are engaged in values and National Education talks and activities. These programmes are carried out by the school leaders, teachers and students, who share stories and articles on the Traits of MFPS, our School Core values and National Education messages. The presenters use varied innovative strategies and resources to make their sharing more interesting and interactive for the students.

**Let’s Bond & Have a Break with Me! Programme (One-to-One Teacher-Student Interaction Time)**<br>
In MFPS, we strongly believe that quality teacher-student relationships in a classroom make the students feel important and valued. This will lead to quality thinking and teaching, and eventually to quality results. As form teachers play a central role in shaping the development of students, they have interaction time with students in the mornings from 7.10 am to 7.25 am to identify their needs and nurture their character traits, dispositions and attitudes. This quality conversation enables the teachers to support students in their learning and development.

**"Caught Being Good" Affirmation Programme**<br>

Motivation is the key to learning and good behaviour, especially for children. In Mayflower Primary School, we intentionally catch students demonstrating good behaviour and acknowledge their effort.   

The ‘Caught Being Good’ Affirmation programme rewards good behaviour with stickers. Any student can receive a sticker from any teacher who catches him/her displaying the school values, traits of an Empowered Learner or Empathetic Leader, or good learning dispositions. At the end of the term, the school awards badges to students with the highest number of stickers.

This programme not only encourages students to exhibit positive behaviour consistently but also helps teachers to be more conscious about watching out for positive behaviour in students. We believe that this visual affirmation reinforces good behavior and more importantly, increases students' self-esteem. In time to come, students will comprehend that good behaviour is reward unto itself.
