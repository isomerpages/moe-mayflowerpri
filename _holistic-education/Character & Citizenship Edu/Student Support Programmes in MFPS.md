### **Student Support Programmes in MFPS**
In MFPS, different resources and trained personnel from discipline, counselling and learning support are integrated and activated to meet our students’ needs. For students who may require more intervention, respective school-based personnel perform various functions and roles to implement and monitor programmes to support them holistically (cognitive, affective, psychological and physical) using our school’s Stage Referral System
