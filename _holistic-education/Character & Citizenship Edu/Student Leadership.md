### **Student Leadership**
#### **Learning Outcomes**
Student Leadership at Mayflower Primary School is focused on the spirit of the school’s motto, “Service before Self”. In line with our motto, our vision for our student leaders, **“To Lead, is to Serve”**, highlights that leadership begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, and that conscious effort makes one a good leader.

We strongly believe that with opportunities and training provided, our students’ leadership skills can be developed for them to exemplify the traits of an Empowered Learner and an Empathetic Leader.

**Approach**

A structured approach to develop the leadership potential of our students is put in place to equip them with the essential knowledge, skills, values and traits to build their competencies to be future-ready leaders.   

It also develops our students into confident citizens who contribute actively to the well-being of others.

#### **Department Programme**
A tiered and progressive leadership programme is in place for all Primary 1 to 6 students. Within the class, leadership is structured so that every student has an opportunity to serve at the group, subject, or class level.   

From Primary 3 onwards, students experience a cohort leadership training once a year to hone their personal, team, and community leadership skills. Through this programme, students will learn to be:

* Proactive citizens who look out for opportunities to serve others;
* Resilient problem solvers who reflect on and learn from their experiences; and
* Collaborative team players who create, share and build knowledge with their teachers and peers

Beyond the classroom, we systematically identify, train, monitor, evaluate, and celebrate a student’s leadership development. Opportunities are created for students to put into practice their leadership skills and traits, and role-model values.

**Primary 4 Cohort Leadership Training 2022**<br>
Students who demonstrate a higher level of leadership skills are identified from as early as Primary 4 to serve as ambassadors or Junior Prefects. At the pinnacle of our leadership tier is our Prefects Executive Committee (or ExCo for short). Led by the Head Prefect, the Prefects ExCo lead the entire school in thinking about school improvements, via Minds@Work, and role model what it means to be an Empowered Learner and Empathetic Leader as they work for the betterment of the school and the wider community.
