### **Character & Citizenship Education (MTL)**
#### **Learning Outcomes**
Character & Citizenship Education (Mother Tongue Languages) form part of the explicit teaching and learning of moral values, by using cultural stories, practices, songs, idioms, and proverbs unique to each Mother Tongue Language.

Students explore how values are lived in the past in our communities and the relevance of these values to our lives and today’s context. For students who offer the non-Tamil Indian Languages or are exempted from taking MTL, lessons will be taught in English.

At the end of the CCE programme, students would be able to:

* put good values into practice
* be responsible in their actions
* cultivate good communication and social skills
* develop good habits as a result of consistently doing what is right and good
* promote harmony and social cohesion in a multiracial and multi-religious society

#### **Teaching Approaches**
Learning values is more authentic for students as daily life experiences and current, real-world affairs are used as learning contexts to make learning more meaningful and relevant. Aligned to the three overarching CCE ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices, students find familiarity in the six domains, starting with the self and extending to the family, school, community, nation and the world. 

The CCE (MTL) curriculum also complements the National Education Commemorative Days, with activities that extend students’ learning experiences of Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, and Racial Harmony Day.
