### **Values In Action (VIA)**
#### **Learning Outcomes**
Values In Action (VIA) is one of the key student development experiences that contributes towards the holistic development of our students in the physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral and social domains. VIA programmes give students the opportunity to exemplify the values and traits that they learn in the ExCitE! curriculum, in a way that benefits their class, school, and the wider community.

#### **Teaching Approaches**
This 6-year VIA curriculum looks into the progressive development of students as Empowered Learners and Empathetic Leaders. We aim to develop in our students a social conscience, encourage them to be of service, and contribute actively to those in their community and in the wider society.

Teachers facilitate students’ exploration of real-life and current issues, like the impact of Covid-19 or the growing need for sustainable living. Upon identification of the issue, students then work with their peers to plan for their VIA Projects using the Design Thinking Approach.

Students are guided to empathize and identify community issues that they are concerned about, understand the issues, and initiate action among their peers to make a difference and improve the lives of others. 

Students will then be given opportunities to reflect on their learning experience, internalise the values and think about how they can do better moving forward.

#### **VIA Projects**
Students are grouped into lower (Primary 1 and 2), middle (Primary 3 and 4) and upper (Primary 5 and 6) blocks to ensure a spiral acquisition of knowledge, skills and values.
