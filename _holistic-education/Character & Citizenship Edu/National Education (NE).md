### **National Education (NE)**
#### **Learning Outcomes**
National Education is an important part of Character & Citizenship Education. We aim to provide opportunities for our students to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans, and arrive at a common set of ideals and values. We equip students with the knowledge, skills, and values to understand Singapore’s history and unique geo-political context, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future. The following **Key Dispositions** shape the purpose and approach for National Education:

Classroom-based National Education learning experiences take place during CCE and Social Studies lessons. Beyond the classroom, key student development events like Cohort Learning Journeys and National Education Commemorative Days deepen students’ experiences, allowing students to see the connection between what they learn in the classroom and real life.

#### **Social Studies Curriculum**

The Social Studies curriculum helps students to grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to our society and the world in which we live. 

The curriculum prepares students to be effective citizens by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. 

Through an inquiry-based approach, students explore real-world issues that concern their lives, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives.

##### **Cohort Learning Journeys** 
**Heritage Trail to Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Little India**<br>
To provide our Primary 4 to 6 students with opportunities to experience, understand and appreciate Singapore’s socio-cultural, geo-political, historical and economic contexts, learning journeys to heritage sites such as Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Little India are organized for them.

#### **National Education Show (2022)**
The National Education (NE) Show instills a sense of patriotism in our students and highlights the significance of National Day. Every year, the National Day Parade (NDP) full dress rehearsal provides an opportunity to inculcate NE values in our Primary 5 students. Through this NE show, we hope our students will be able to identify ways to show love, care and respect for Singapore

#### **National Education Commemorative Days**
**National Education Commemorative Days are one of the key student development experiences that reinforce the knowledge, skills, and values taught in our CCE curriculum.**

Students commemorate key events related to the formation of our Singaporean identity, building a sense of belonging, reality, and hope; which culminate in a will to act.
