### **Malay Language**
#### **Learning Outcomes**
To equip our students with literacy skills enabling them to be linguistically competent and confident users of the Malay Language, to think critically and creatively and to identify, explore and understand the cultures and values of the Malay culture and language.

#### **Teaching Approaches**
Malay Language lessons are designed with effective learner centred pedagogies to enhance ML learning and engagement of students, to support the development of four main skills: listening, reading, viewing, speaking and writing. Teachers and students embark on various teaching and assessment strategies through ICT, Differentiated Instruction, Experiential Learning, Joy of Reading, Assessment for Learning and the 5W1H to deepen students’ learning experiences. Great emphasis is also placed to ensure that students are trained in utilizing the POLYA thinking routine in problem solving.

To create an environment conducive for the learning of Mother Tongue (MT), the MT department organizes an annual two-week programme to encourage our students to use and deepen their knowledge in the Malay Language and Culture. The objective of MTL Fortnight is to ignite and deepen students’ interest in using their Mother Tongue. Many interesting, wide-ranging outside-class MTL activities are provided to enable students to learn and use MTL in an exciting way.

#### **Department Programmes**
Keeping the objective of stimulating and sustaining our students’ interest in learning Malay in mind, the Malay Language Department has also put in place a range of differentiated enrichment activities designed to expose our students culturally while promoting opportunities for meaningful interaction and collaboration amongst students

#### **Reading Programme**
We believe in the Joy of Reading and we want our students to be hooked on reading. We create opportunities for students to read in class and beyond the classroom. We ring-fence specific periods for Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) during curriculum where students spend quiet moments reading age-appropriate books from a selection of books recommended by teachers based on reading competency. Teachers can assign titles for individual students as well as monitor students’ reading through SLS.

#### **Talent Development**
Students are given a variety of platforms to display their potential to their fullest. Students are sent as competitors and representatives in school competitions and various prominent inter-school competitions to widen their exposure to the Malay Language
