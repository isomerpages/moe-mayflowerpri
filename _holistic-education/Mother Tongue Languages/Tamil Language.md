### **Tamil Language**
#### **Learning Outcomes**
To equip our students with literacy skills, enabling them to be linguistically competent and confident users of the Tamil Language, think critically and creatively and to identify, explore and understand the cultures and values of the Indian culture and Tamil language.      

#### **Teaching Approaches**
Tamil language (TL) lessons are designed using effective learner-centred pedagogies to enhance TL learning and engagement of students, to support the development of four main skills: listening, reading, viewing, speaking and writing. Students learn through meaningful and effective tasks on given platforms, hence making TL learning more enjoyable and meaningful. Teachers and students embark on various teaching and assessment strategies through ICT, Differentiated Instruction, Making Thinking Visible, Assessment for Learning and the 5W1H. 

#### **Department Programmes**
Keeping the objective of stimulating and sustaining our students’ interest in learning the language, the TL Department has also put in place a range of differentiated enrichment activities designed to expose our students culturally while promoting opportunities for meaningful interaction and collaboration amongst students. This includes a two-week programme to encourage our students to use their Mother Tongue and appreciate the Tamil culture. During MTL Fortnight, a wide-range of outside-class TL activities will be provided to enable students to learn and use the language in an exciting way.
