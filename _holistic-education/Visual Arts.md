### **Visual Arts**
#### **Learning Outcomes**
* To develop our students as an active artist and informed audience with:
* visual inquiry skills to discover and explore their surrounding;
* curiosity, imagination and enjoyment in art-making and art discussion;
* confidence in working individually and in groups to focus ideas and create artworks; and
* awareness and respect for histories and cultures of key artworks and artists in Singapore and the world.

Apart from visual arts subject knowledge and skills, the study of visual arts aims to nurture sound values, develop students’ social emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies of:

* Critical and Inventive Thinking (CIT);
* Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills (CCI) and
* Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills (CGC).

#### **Teaching Approaches**
In order to achieve the learning outcomes, our art teachers strive to provide a student-centric curriculum that promotes greater student agency through:

* Inquiry-based lessons;
* Choice-based lessons and
* Museum-based lessons.

With the above approaches, students acquire knowledge, skills and values through positive classroom culture, sound lesson preparation, effective use of teaching actions /activities and quality feedback for learning.

Our art teachers strive to train students in artful thinking routines through the spiral approach. The design of our visual arts curriculum emphasizes the various artful thinking routines across all levels. As our students progress up the levels, new routines will be introduced while previous routines are revisited at a deeper level.

#### **Talent Identification and Development Education**
MFPS Visual Arts Talent Identification and Development Education (**VATIDE**) aims to identify students who are interested and / or talented in visual arts. Talent identification is mainly through our interaction with students during curriculum time (Art Lessons), CCA Art Club and teacher / parent recommendations. Development education for identified students is carried out via a few platforms:

* Individual/small group coaching sessions after school;
* Specialized art-making clinics;
* Portfolio building sessions;
* Project-based art-making sessions and
* Training sessions for competitions.

**VATIDE** serves as a specialized platform to guide and develop students with knowledge, skills and studio practices at intermediate/advance levels. This selected group of students are either aspiring budding artists who wish to pursue art in their secondary and tertiary education or are highly motivated and passionate in developing their artistic skills and talents.
